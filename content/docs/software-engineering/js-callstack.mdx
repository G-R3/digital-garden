title: JS Callstack
description: Notes on the JS callstack
---

in JS, the callstack is a stack of function calls that the code has made. In most, non-functional
programming languages, there is an upper limit to how far you can go before hitting a `Maximum call stack size exceeded` error. Functional programming languages don't have this limit because you use patterns like recursion for everything.

From what I understand, ES6 (ECMAScript 6) specified proper tail call optimization in the spec, but most engines (e.g. V8 in Chrome/Node) never implemented it, so the stack limit is still there in practice.
