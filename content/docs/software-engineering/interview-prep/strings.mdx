Strings are basically just arrays of characters

```typescript
let string = "Hello"; // ["H", "e", "l", "l", "o"];
```

In most languages, strings are immutable. This means that when we modify a string, we are not modfying the orignal. We create a new one under the hood.

```typescript
let originalString = "hello"; // ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
let modifiedString = originalString + "!"; // ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o", "!"]
```

This can have some performance implications. For example, say we are building a result string. A common mistake is to iterate over the string and concat the result with the current character of the iteration. This can lead to an `O(N^2)` time complexity

```typescript
let result = "";
for (char in string) {
  result += char;
}
```

under the hood, this is creating a new string on every iteration
Instead we should be creating a list of characters and joining them at the end. This gets us back to `O(N)`

```typescript
let result = [];
for (char in string) {
  result.append(char);
}

return result.join("");
```

Aside from this, strings work very similarly to arrays.

## When to use

- Find the longest substring without repeating characters
- Check if two strings are anagrams
- Return all the subtrings that match a patter

^ most of these are hidden as sliding window or two pointer problems

String problems are almost never about brute force character checking. They are about smart windowing, smart lookups, and efficient traversal.
