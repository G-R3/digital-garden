title: Quickstart to building a CLI tool
description: A small guide to start building a CLI tool

For this entry, I will be using `Bun` and `TypeScript`.

Steps:

1. `Bun` init. This will create an entry-point file, a `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`
2. Add appropriate shebang to the top of the entry-point file. For bun this would be `#!/usr/bin/env bun`
3. To make the entry-point file executable, we need to update its permissions by running `chmod +x <entry-point>`
4. Add `bin` to `package.json` to map the command name to the entry-point file

```
"bin": {
    "my-cli": "./entry-point.ts"
}
```

5. Link the package by running `bun link` to install the package globally and allow the package to be available anywhere in the terminal
6. test by calling the CLI

```bash
> my-cli
Hello, World!
```
