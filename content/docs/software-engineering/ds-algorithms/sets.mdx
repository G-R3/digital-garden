title: Sets
description: Set data structure
---

A collection of unique values. No duplicates, no particular order. A group of elements where each one only appears once

## Operations

Here I'm referring to Hash Sets which are typically implemented using hash tables

#### Accessing -> `O(1)`

- We can quickly find an element by hashing its value.

#### Removing -> `O(1)`

- only need to hash the element to find and remove it

#### Insert -> `O(1)`

- since Sets are typically implemented using hash tables, we can read in constant time
- check emptiness -> `O(1)`

## When to use

You should always use a Set instead of an Array when you care about:

- Uniqueness (Like checking for duplicates)
- Existence (Have I seen this element before?)
- Fast membership check (Is this element in this group)

In a problem where we're scanning an array to find the first repeated element, using a Set is usually the cleanest and fastest solution

- Sliding window problems (you'd want to make sure all elements in the window are unique. In that way a set becomes a way to track what's in-play and what needs to be removed)

Sets are NOT for storing `key: value` pairs. They are for tracking if something exists(?).
