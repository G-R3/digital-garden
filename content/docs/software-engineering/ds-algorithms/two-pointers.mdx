Two pointers is great for solving problems that involve linear structures like arrays, strings, and even linked lists sometimes.

the key is to recognize when to use it and how to adapt it to the shape of your problem.

two pointers involves using two pointers, or indices, to move through a structure. Usually in a way to help you avoid nested loops
or repeated scanning. Like reading a book with two fingers. One track the start of something and the other tracks the end.

The trick is in how they move and why.

## Two major types of techniques

### Same direction

both pointers move in the same direction

#### When to use

- Use it when doing a single pass over the data but you need to track a range and not just one element at a time.

- fast and slow two pointer set up. One pointer moving one step at a time and the other moving fast, two steps at a time. This lets you detect patterns in a single pass. For example, if the fast pointer reaches the end while one is halfway, you found the middle. If the fast pointer ever laps the slow pointer, you've detected a cycle.

### Opposite ends

pointers move towards each other from opposite ends
One starts at the beginning and the other at the end.

here is the mental model:

- left pointer starts at zero. right pointer start at the last index.
- check the current pair
- based on some condition you move one of the pointers inwards
  - the condition is always problem specific. So it could be their sum or checking if the two characters match.

Opposite ends is great with sorted arrays because each time you move a pointer you can remove an entire range of possabilities. Instead of checking all combinations, O(N^2), you're solving it in O(N).

#### When to use

- when finding pairs or combinations in a sorted array
- Comparing symmetric parts of a structure. Checking for palindromes
- Want to avoid nested loops when looking at all pairs.

Two pointers are great because they help:

- reduce the number of iterations you'll need
- track a relationship between two places in a structure
- avoid extrac space by not needing Sets or Maps

its one of a few techniques to maximize time and space complexity at once.

you just need to recognize the shape of the problem

## When to use

- Palindromes
- reversals
- merging sorted data
- "K" sized comparisons

often the problem won't say to use Two pointers but if the brute force solution is checking all pairs or scanning repeatedly. Its usually a sign that
theres is a more efficient way.

You should be asking yourself this: "Can i do this by just walking the array once from both side or in one pass?"

- if yes, two pointers is probably the most efficient way to go.
