Mostly data structures and algorithms stuff that I tend to forget. The info here is mostly sourced from various videos, books, and online blogs that I've come accross over the years.

Almost all interview problems boil down to three things:

1. Loop
2. Some condition
3. A few variables being updated

mentally run your code. Keep track of pointers and what your loop is doing when you code.

Additionally, always think about what it is you’re doing—what the end goal is—instead of just jumping straight into coding. This is a common mistake. Take sometime to think about the problem where you're going.

## Important concepts for big-Oh

1. Growth with respect to input
2. Drop the constants
3. Always consider the worst case, usually.
