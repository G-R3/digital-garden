title: Trie
description: Trie data structure
---

Pronounced as "try", it is a type of tree but it's often used to store characters. Also known as a prefix tree.

each node might store a character as its data and by following the path from the root to a given node, that
node is representing a word or a part of a word

Gives us very quick lookups of a particular kind

Take this dictionary as an example of words we store:

```
Car
Card
Cards
Cot
Cots
Trie
Tried
Tries
Try
```

We can use a trie to say "Hey are there any words that start with 'c', 'a', and 'r'?"
yes there are. We have "car" which is a complete word. There is also "card" in which "car" is also a prefix.

Tries are great for word validation problems

- "Given this list of strings find all celebrity names"
- "Imagine that you're implementing autocomplete for a video search engine..."

don't look up each prefix from the root. instead, build from past calls
by keeping state within the trie or returning the node to the caller.

## Operations

#### Insert -> `O(N)`

- N is the length of the word

## When to use

- word search
- prefix matching
- auto complete
