also known as cumulative sum. It's essentially a sequence of running totals

In an array, the prefix sum at any position is the sum of all elements up to that position.

example: [1, 2, 4, 6]
prefix sum: [1, 3, 7, 13]

For an array of A elements [A0,A1, A2, ..., An] P of length n+1 is defined as:

```
P[0] = 0 (an empty sum)
P[i] = P[0] + P[1] + P[2] + ... P[i] for 1 <= i <= n
```

So given [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2] the prefix sum would be:

```
P[0] = 0 (empty sum)
P[1] = 0 + 3 = 3
P[2] = 3 + 1 = 4
P[3] = 4 + 4 = 8
P[4] = 8 + 1 = 9
P[5] = 9 + 5 = 14
P[6] = 14 + 9 = 23
P[7] = 23 + 2 = 25

prefix sum = [0, 3, 4, 8, 9, 14, 23, 25]

```

With this prefix sum array, we can quickly find the sum of any contiguous subarray of the original array. For example, to find the sum of elements from index 2 to index 4 (1-indexed), we calculate P[6] - P[2] = 23 - 4 = 19, which equals 4 + 1 + 5 + 9
