description: Linking local packages during development

The `link` command creates a symlink between a local package and a project, making it easy to develop packages and apps simultaneously.

When developing a library and an app at the same time, the traditional workflow is painful:

1. change library code
2. rebuild
3. publish or pack
4. reinstall in the app
5. repeat

The `link` command addresses this by creating a direct symlink to a local package. After running `bun link` (or `npm link`) in your library directory and `bun link <package-name>` in another app, changes to the library are immediately available in the app without republishing or reinstalling the library/package.

Can also be added as a dependecy with bun:

```
 "dependencies": {
    "cool-pkg": "link:cool-pkg"
  }
```

This convenience makes local package development much faster and more iterative.
