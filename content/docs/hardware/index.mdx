Random notes/thoughts as I start learning more about electronics and hardware

## Transducers

- change other types of energy into electrical energy and vice versa.
- speakers or light bulbs

## Sensors

- components that convert other forms of energy into electrical energy

## Actuators

- components that change electrical energy into other forms of energy

## Circuits

- used to move energy between different types of components
- closed loops of wires with a power source (like a battery) and something to do something useful with the energy, called a load.

In a circuit, electricity flows from a point of higher potential energy (usually referred to as power or `+`) to a point of lower potential energy called `Ground` (often represented with `-` or `GND`)

## Direct Current (DC) circuit

- electricity flows in one direction

## Alternating Current (AC)

- electricity changes direction 50 or 60 times a second.
  - So more precisely: 50 or 60 cycles per second (Hz); the direction of current actually reverses 100 or 120 times per second (twice per cycle).
- the type of electricity that comes from wall sockets.

## Current

- the amount of electrical charge flowing past a certain point in the circuit.
- measured in `amperes`, or `amps` with the `A` symbol

## Voltage

- The difference in energy between one point in a circuit and another.
- measured in `volts`; with the `V` symbol

## Resistance

- measured in `ohms` with the `Ω` (`$\Omega$`) symbol
- How much a component resists the flow of electrical energy

## Other

- There needs to be a complete path from the energy source (`power`) to the point of least energy (`Ground`) to make a circuit. Otherwise, gg it won't work.
- All of the electrical energy in a circuit gets used up in a circuit by the components in it. Each component converts some of that energy into other forms of energy. In any circuit, all of that voltage is converted into other forms of energy (light, heat, sound, etc.)
- The flow of current at a specific point in a circuit will always be the same coming in and going out.
- Electrical current will always seek the path of least resistance to `Ground`
  - if you have a connection that connects `power` to `ground` together with no resistance you will cause a short circuit, and the current will try to follow that path.
  - in a short circuit the power source and wires converts the electrical energy into light and heat, usually as sparks or an explosion lol very dangerous.

- Schematics are an abstract way of showing the relationships between components in a circuit. They don't always show where components are placed relative to each other, but they show how they are connected.
