title: Ohm's Law
description: the law
---

current, voltage and resistance are all related. When one is changed in a circuit, it effects the others.
This is Ohm's law. Named after George Simon Ohm

```
Voltage (v) = Current (I) * Resistance (R)
```

When measuring amperage, a milliamp is thousandths of one amp.

Say we have a circuit with an LED. The circuit is being supplied 5V and a resistor is offering 200 ohms resistance. To find
amperage used by the LED we use the formula above

```
5 (v) = I * 220 (R)

5 (v) / 220 (R) = I

0.023 = I
```

**The total amount of amps use by the LED is 0.023, or 23 thousandths of an amp, or 23 milliamps (23 mA)**

- this value is just about the max you can safely use with some LEDs, which is why we use a 220 ohm resistor.
