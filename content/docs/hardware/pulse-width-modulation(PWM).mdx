title: Pulse Width Modulation(PWM)

> Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is a technique used to control the average power delivered to a load by varying the duty cycle of a rectangular wave signal. It is commonly used in applications like motor control and LED dimming, where the average voltage and current can be adjusted by rapidly switching the power on and off.

With an arduino microcontroller, for example, we can't vary the output voltage on its pins. It can only output 5V. So we use PWM pins to rapidly turn the output pin `HIGH` and `LOW` over a fixed period of time.

change happens faster than the human eye can see. It's similar to how movies work by flashing a bunch of still images to create the illusion of motion.

When rapidly changing a pin from `HIGH` to `LOW` it's as if we are changing the voltage.

## Duty Cycle

The percentage of time a pin is `HIGH`

When a pin is `HIGH` for half the period and `LOW` for the other half, the `duty cycle` is 50%.

A lower `duty cycle` can give you a dimmer LED than a high `duty cycle`
