A voltage divider is a simple circuit that splits a voltage into a smaller, predictable voltage using resistors.

> To produce a predictable fraction of a voltage.

> A voltage divider circuit is a very common circuit that takes a higher voltage and converts it to a lower one by using a pair of resistors. The formula for calculating the output voltage is based on Ohms Law and is shown below.

## Formula

```
Vout = Vin * (R2 / R1 + R2)
```

For a basic two-resistor divider where:

    - `Vin` is the source voltage, measured in volts `(V)`,
    - `R1` is the resistance of the 1st resistor, measured in Ohms `(Ω)`. Connected to the input.
    - `R2` is the resistance of the 2nd resistor, measured in Ohms `(Ω)`. Connected to ground.
    - `Vout` is the output voltage, measured in volts `(V)`,
