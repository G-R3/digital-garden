A process by which a changing electrical current in a wire can generate a changing magnetic field around the wire.

### Example with motors:

A motor can generate its own electrical current through induction. When it's given electricity, a tightly wound coil inside the housing of copper creates a magnetic field. This field causes the shaft (the part that sticks out of the housing) to spin around.

The reverse is also true. A motor can generate electricity when the shaft is spun around.

Try this: attach an LED to the two leads of a motor, then spin the shaft with your hands. If nothing happens spin the shaft the other way. The LED should light up. This essentially creates a tiny generator out of the motor!!!

When we stop supplying the motor with electricity, it will continue to spin because it has inertia. When it's spinning like this it will generate voltage in the opposite direction from the current that it was given.

This reverse voltage, sometimes called `back-voltage`, can damage your components like `transistors`. To mitigate, you can put a `diode` in parallel with the motor so that `back-voltage` passes through the `diode`.
