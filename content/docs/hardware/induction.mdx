A process by which a changing electrical current in a wire can generate a changing magnetic field around the wire.

### Example with motors:

a motor, It can generate its own electrical current through induction. When its given electricity, a tighly wound coil inside the housing of copper creates a magnetic field. This field causes the shaft (the part that sticks out of the housing) to spin around.

The reverse is also true. A motor can generate electricity when the shaft is spin around.

Try this: attach an LED to the two leads of a motor, then spin the shaft with your hands. If nothing happens spin the shaft the other way. The LED should light up. This essentilly create a tiny generator out of the motor!!!

When we stop supplying the motor with electricity, it will continue to spin because it has inertia. When it's spin like this it will generate voltage in the opposite direction than the current that it was given.

This reverse voltage, sometimes called `back-voltage`, can damage your components like `transistors`. To mitigate you can put a `diode`in parallel with the motor so that `back-voltage` passes through the `diode`.
