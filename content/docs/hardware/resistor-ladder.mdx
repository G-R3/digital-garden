Can be used as a way to read a number of switches using the analog input. A useful technique if you find yourself short of digital inputs.

Basically, the arrangement of switches and resistors feeding into an input is called the resistor ladder.

When switches are pressed, different voltage levels are created at the analog input (A0) depending on which switches are closed. Each switch combination produces a unique voltage that can be read and decoded.

> A resistor ladder is an electrical circuit consisting of repeating units of resistors arranged in a ladder-like topology, serving as a passive network for signal processing in both analog and digital systems. This configuration enables the division or scaling of voltages and currents through interconnected resistive elements, facilitating tasks such as voltage attenuation or weighted summation without active components.
