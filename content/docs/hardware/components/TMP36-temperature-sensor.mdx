description: Notes on the TMP36 temperature sensor

outputs a changing voltage depending on the temperature it senses.

it has 3 pins:

- `GND` pin that connects to GROUND
- `POWER` pin that connects to power
- `OUTPUT` pin that outputs a variable voltage

This particular model of temperature sensor outputs a voltage that changes directly proportional to the temperature in degrees Celsius
