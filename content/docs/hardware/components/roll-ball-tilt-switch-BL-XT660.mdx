Model: Roll ball tilt switch BL-XT660

They are used to detect orientation. They work in a similar way as any other switch in that its an ON/OFF sensor.

This particular model detects orientation by utilizing a metal ball within a small cavity inside the housing.
When tilted, the ball rolls to one side of the cavity and connects the two leads on the breadboard, closing the switch.

Accelerometers are another alternative to tilt switches that give out more information but are more expensive. This tilt switch is fine for figuring out if something is up or down.
