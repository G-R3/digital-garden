## Digital input (binary)

Arudion digital pins can only read two states. When it has voltage and when it does not.

These are often referred as `HIGH` and `LOW`

- `HIGH` means there is voltage
- `LOW` means there is no voltage

When turning an output PIN `HIGH` using a function called `digitalWrite()` we are turning it on

- measuring the voltage between the `PIN` and `GROUND` will read 5V

When turning an output PIN `LOW` we are turning it off.

## Other

Arduino digital pins can be used as INPUT and OUTPUT depending on the need

- when they are outputs we can turn on components like LEDs
- when they are inputs we can check for things like if a switch is being pressed or not.
