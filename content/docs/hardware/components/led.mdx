A light-emitting diode that converts electrical energy into light energy

**insert image of an LED**

They are `polarized` components meaning they only allow electrical energy to flow through them in one direction.

The longer leg of an LED is the `anode`

- connects to `power`

The shorter leg of an LED is the `cathode`

- connects to `ground`

When voltage is applied to the anode of the LED, and the cathode is connected to `ground`, the LED emits light
