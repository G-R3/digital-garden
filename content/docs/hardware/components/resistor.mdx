title: Resistors
description: notes on the Resistor component
---

A component that resists the flow of electrical energy by converting some of that energy into heat.

**Insert image of various resistors**

If you put a resistor in series with a component, like an LED, the resistor will use up some of that energy and as a result the LED will receive less energy.

This allows us to supply our components with the amount of electrical energy that it needs.

We use it in a series with other components so that it doesn't receive too much voltage. Without a resistor, the LED would be brighter for a few moments, but quickly burn out.

## Other

- in a series circuit, it does not matter where you place a resistor. For example, the resistor can come after or before an LED (connected to the anode or cathode)
