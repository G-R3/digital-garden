description: notes on the Resistor component
---

A component that resists the flow of electrical energy by converting some of that energy into heat.

**Insert image of various resistors**

If you put a resistor in series with a component, like an LED, the resistor will use up some of that energy and as a result the LED will receive less energy.

This allows us to supply our components with the amount of electrical energy that it needs.

We use it in a series with other components so that it doesn't receive too much voltage. Without a resistor, the LED would be brigher for a few moments, but quickly burn out.
