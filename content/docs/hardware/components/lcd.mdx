LCD allow us to display information via alphaneumeric characters.

For these notes, I will refer to a 16 col by 2 rows Liquid Crystal Display.

- come with a large number of pins for communication and power. It will know what to write to the screen but its not necessary to connect every pin available.

### Pins

- RS (register select) pins controls where the characters will appear on the screen
- R/W (read/write) pins will put the screenin read or write mode
- EN (enable) tells the LCD that it will be receiving a command
- D0 - D7 (data pins) pins are used to send character data to the screen
  - they tell the LCD what character should be display
- V0 pins allows changing the contrast.
  - you can mess around with contract by connecting it with a potentiometer
- VSS and LED- need to be connected to ground. As well as the R/W pin as this places the screen in write mode
- VCC (power suply) pin should be connected directly to 5V
- LED+ pin connects to power via a 200 ohm resistor
