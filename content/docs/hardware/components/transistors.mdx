Allows the control of high current and high voltage power sources from the low current output of a microconntroller, like the arduino uno.

- many different transistors but they all work from the same principal

> You can think of transistors as a digital switch. When you provide voltage to one of the transistor's pins, called the `gate`, it closes the circuit between the other two pins, call the `source` and `drain`.

- this allows us to turn a higher current and higher voltage component, like a motor, ON/OFF with a microconntroller that can't supply those current/voltage requirements.

- Transistors are solid state devices, they have no moving parts. Therefore, you can switch them ON/OFF very quickly.
