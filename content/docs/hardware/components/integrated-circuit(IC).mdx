Components that hold large circuits in a tiny package. Can help with simplifying more complex circuits by placing them in an easily replaceable component.

You can access a circuit through its various pins that come out the side. Different `IC`s have different numbers of pins and not all of them are used in every circuit.

It can be convenient to refer to the pins via number instead of function.

When looking at an `IC` the part with a dimple is referred to as the "top"

Pins are identified by counting from the top-left in a "U" direction.

A type of `IC` with a number of transistors built in.
